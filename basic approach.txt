Approach
---------

Stage 1 - Text Parsing with CNN + rule based
---------------------------------------------

phase 1 -  
Finding the ROI

-  highly complex


phase 2 - 
Apply some image processing techniques and make the borders of segmentation maps clear.
Extract the regions and tag them and just take the required regions 
- highly complex



Stage 2 - Generating vector from text and training a ML model
-------------------------------------------------------------

phase 3 -
- parsing and text summarization and generate vectors for each of regions like experience, technical skills - complex
- find similarity score with JD and train a ML model - easy
