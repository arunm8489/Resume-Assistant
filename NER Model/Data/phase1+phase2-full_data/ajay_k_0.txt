PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN in COLLEGE
@ NPAs Prediction of Banking Systems in India
o This project was part of Data Mining course. Problem statement was to predict NPAs of banking system in India. Used
different types regression algorithms along with feature engineering techniques e.g. (Relief family of algorithms for
feature selection)
e Hypothesis Testing for Multiple Distributions
o Performed Goodness of fit tests to check type of distribution the raw data is following- Chi Square test, Kolmogorov-Smimov
and Anderson Darling test.
2+ years of PROFESSIONAL-EXPERIENCE in QUANTIPHI
e Interactive Chatbot: - Designed a fully trained insights-interactive chatbot for insurance domain using the Dialogflow and NLP.
It has all the advanced features like sending mail, push notifications, setting reminder for the calendar invites.
e Bottle cap Recognition: - Had to recognise characters (combination of number and alphabets in any orientation) on a bottle cap
image. Used transfer learning for bounding box detection for area of interest and further trained ML modes (CNN+RNN) for
character level recognition.
e Table Detection and content Extraction: - Successfully detected tables from articles (Implemented Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN,
SSD for detection) on top of detection also used OCR to extract the contents in the spreadsheet. Deployed the same in AWS.
@ Leaving Group Prediction: - This project was based on classification problem in which we had to predict the probabilities of
leaving groups. Used different types of ML Algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Sklearn Linear models). Deployed the
same using Flask-Framework to create a RESTAPI and hosted the same on cloud.
@e Anomaly Detection: - Successfully implemented AutoEncoder for anomaly detection in sensor dataset. Created a RESTAPI and
deployed it in AWS using custom docker-image.
@ Key-Value Pair Extraction: - Successfully extracted key value pairs from claim document under a insurance domain. Tried deep
learning algorithms and Spacy pipeline.
