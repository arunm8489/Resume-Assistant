PROJECTS
An Advanced Document Understanding System using Machine Learning:
Developed Machine Learning based software system to develop text-classification for custom labels on
sections (paragraph, title, etc) of the document:
Machine Learning model using Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms viz. tree-based model, boosting and
bagging.
Developed model using the LSTM model for text-classification.
The F1-score of 0.84 is achieved on the validation set.
Developed and Deployed the Software pipeline for training the model and predicting using trained models
Worked on the Software Engineering aspect of the system to ensure High Coding Standard.
Writing Code for generic & utility function.
Social Media Spam Detection using Transformer Model:
Frameworks used -BERT, PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Studied various algorithms for textual data like N-gram, RNN, LSTM.
Pre-processed textual data, cleaned noisy data using Pandas framework and custom codes.
Implemented bidirectional encoding representation (BERT) model in PyTorch.
Evaluated results with Scikit-learn library.
Scored F1 score 0.91
