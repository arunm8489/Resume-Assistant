AX2021 8-Bit CMOS Microcontroller
Description of a recent project: The AX2021 is a line of 8051-compatible, the digital peripherals include
UART, EMI, and SPI interfaces, four timers, a USB 2.0 full-speed host/device controller, and an MP3
decoder engine. The analog peripherals include an RC oscillator, crystal oscillator, DAC, ADC, PLL,
brown-out protection, Power Gate, and low-dropout regulator. Instruction throughput is up to 48 MIPS,
with all instructions single-cycle except program branches. The USB 2.0 host/device controller FIFO is
shared with instruction RAM. It supports full-speed USB 2.0. The MP3 Decoder Engine can decode
MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-2.5 Audio Layer 1, 2, 3 decoder under 24 MHz.
