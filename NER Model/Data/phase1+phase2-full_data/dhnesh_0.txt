Summary of Projects
e SEO Tags Recommendation Using NLP (Gensim,NLTK,Tensorflow, Quepy)
Used pre-trained Word2vec word embeddings for text articles as inputs for SEO Tags Classification.
Trained the model with 40k different relevant HTML tags on Bidirectional LSTM using Tensorflow.
Achieved an accuracy of 76% after applying various hyperparameter tuning techniques.
e Motion Capture for Human Pose Estimation (OpenCV, Pillow, Scikit-lmage, Keras)
Automated Data Preprocessing and Data Agumentation for thousands of images in sync with AWS S3
Buckets. The goal is to create an optimized automated data pipeline of input images to do Masking,
Rescaling, Gaussian Blurring, Pixelating of different types of images, and creating data segments for
Training CNN Based Models. The result is removal of unnecessary noise and an improved model which
learns the pixel features of the images effectively thereby enhancing the accuracy.
e A Prototype for Social-Personality Detection (CoreNLP, Spacy, Tensorflow)
Preprocessing Steps involved Document Level and Word Level Feature Extraction with Filtering Sentences
that do not carry any Personality Clues. Experimented with our model architecture on FastText and
TextCNN for better understanding of the problem.
