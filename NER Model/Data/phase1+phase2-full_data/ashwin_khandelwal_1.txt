Algorithms for face recognition typically extract facial features and compare them to
a database to find the best match. For recognizing face haar features have been used.
Automated Vehicle Keeping the track of vehicles entering the campus through capturing the images of
Identification System vehicle and using background subtraction to detect the car from the image. Further,
using optical character recognition to extract the numbers from the number plate.
RF Transceiver We have built a simple RF transmitter at 27 mhz. Aim of project is to design the
transmitter that should be small enough and fit into the palm of hand and should
operate within government regulations for power output and frequency ranges.
