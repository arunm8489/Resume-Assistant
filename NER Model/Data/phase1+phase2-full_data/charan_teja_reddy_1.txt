Project : Probability prediction on Loan Defaulter
Description:: The Target ofthis project isto develop the classification model on the historical data of bank and predict
whether the person is going to default Loan or not.
¢ Cleaning and pre-processing the data. Handling the Imbalanced data using the Sampling Technique or (SMOTE). Training
Various Classification model and validating the model against the New Sample Deploying the best classification model.
¢ This provides the banking companies to disburse the loan or approve the loan on the basis of the Details of the
customers.
Project: churn analysis - telecommunication industry
Description: The Target of this project is to build the classification model on the historical data of Telecommunication
industry and predict which customer may leave the company.
¢ Inthis case both the machine learning and Deep learning model were Implemented . As we have to Set callbacks, Early
stoppage for the best model rather than over-fitting the deep neural network and figuring Out which customer may
Churn.
¢ This ease the telecommunication industry to find the customer who may Quit and providing them the best Services and
plans for the particular customer to retain.
Project: Named Entity Recognition and Web Crawler
Description: The goal is to design and develop web crawler using python to crawl and scrape the data from a website(Using
Scrapy) and Developed the model to read the required fields from a set of forms scrapped from the clients website using
Scrapy and store them in JSON format as per business requirement.
Project : RPP : Regulatory Portfolio planning
Description: : The goal is to load the files from the AWS cloud to landing layer. On top that layer we created a parquet file
whichthen willbeload into the Dynamo DB priorto which allthe transformation logic(AWS Glue) has been applied. Againwe
create a parquet file and then dump the data into Data mart. On top of that the ATHENA DB tables will be mapped.
