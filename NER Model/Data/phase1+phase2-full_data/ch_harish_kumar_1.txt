Projects/Products:-
Client Obligor Mapping :
в Project Goal Is to map the Obligor with CAPIQ Data Using DataScience.
в Historical Mapping from Business Team Was Used for Preparing Data.
в We make this as a Binary Classification Problem of Mapping right Obligor.
в Along with Obligor Name we used geographical location and sector for analysis.
Knowledge Graph and hierarchial Feature Extraction
в (Along with tfidf and word2vec) Node2vec,DeepWalk used for feature
extraction.
в Improving Modeling using Hierachial weightage .
Technologies Used :
в Apache Kafka with Knative Eventing Used for processing large request base.
Performance Improvements Using Unsupervised ML Technique.
в We faced the problem with Cosine Similarity Caluculation with 10M + records
on serving face took 5-6 secounds.
вл Business required for 1 secounds Used Kmean Clustering On 10 M + records
of TFIDF vectors to split similar groups.
вл Kelbow Visualizer Used for Automatic Selection of K value.
Sector Classification and Capex Entity Extraction
в Level2(70+ Imbalanced ) sector classification of research news.
в NLP Based Text Classification technique used(Deep learning method).
в Keras backed tensorflow was used for model buildings Domain specific
knowledge used for training/learning DL model.
в Standford NER and Custom Entity Extraction CRF model Used along with spacy.
в Semantic search service using Bert-as-Service pretrained model added as
feature.
FinDash Anomaly Detection:
в Project Goal is to Identify outliers in Findash Application.
в Department level outlayer reporting with ML modeling,statistics.
вл Isolation forest algorithm used.
Conversation Engine (CHATBOT WITH RASA) FOR FINTECH CLIENT.
Recommendation Engine module Way2news Product.
