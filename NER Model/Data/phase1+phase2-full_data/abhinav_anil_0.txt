PERSONAL PROJECTS
A Deep Neural Network based approach to segment
medical echocardiography PLAX images into 6 main
heart structures. (03/2021 - Present)
— It has managed to achieve an intersection-over-union (IOU)
accuracy of 89.3% on average (71 test images).
Anomaly Detection on Proprietary Image Dataset
using Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX (05/2021 - 06/2021)
- Model trained ona ‘hazelnut’ dataset of size 800 images. Accuracy
in the ballpark of 95%, evaluation crietria based on heatmap and
dataframe
Boundingbox and Illusion effect in static background
(03/2020 - 05/2020)
— The main achievement is that applying partial segmentation on
each Frame that could be recorded and visible by our eyes and
treat as illusion on the retina.
