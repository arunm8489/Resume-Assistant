PROJECTS AND EXPERIENCE
ZS projects
ZS Associates March 2020 - present
- Worked on the ZS iData research project and solved PoCs, built integrated generalized pipeline for
detecting anomalies in data from various pharma domains like digital marketing, Specialty Pharmacy.
- Developed an intelligent Algorithm Recommendation Engine to automatically select algorithms and
suggest probable probability thresholds for anomalies.
- Worked on developing smart hand-crafted features, which impact anomaly detection immensely.
- Worked on feature explainability, like what features impact model prediction, and the feature values
which pushes prediction of data points to be anomalous or non-anomalous.
