- Also designed an advanced ML pipeline incorporating repetitive Adversarial Validation for improving
model performance through hyper-parameter tuning.
- Working on a novel Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFDL) project- bringing interpretability to
ML models for detecting the disease at an early stage before the requirement of liver biopsy.
 
- Bringing SOTA model performance using complex modifications of Genetic Algorithms.
LGVTON: A Landmark Guided Approach to Virtual Try-On
Summer Research Intern at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata May 2019 - July 2019
- Developed an innovative mechanism of Garment Transfer from one person to another with a different
pose, using Spline Transformations. Link to paper
- Implementations: Pose estimation using Deep Learning, Semantic Segmentation, Non-affine Transfor-
mations, GAN; (tested) Image Inpainting and Shape from shading. Sample results
Artificial Intelligence Projects
RKMVERI, Belurmath August 2019 - December 2019
- Project 1: Automating the game of Pacman by implementing Breadth First Search, Depth First
Search, Uniform Cost Search and A-Star Search algorithms.
- Project 2 (Reinforcement Learning): In this project, we implemented Value Iteration and Q-
Learning. We tested our algorithms first on an agent in a Gridworld (containing target spots, danger
spots as well as reward spots). Then we applied them to a simulated robot crawler and a Pacman.
Automation of the Game of 8 Tiles
Self-paced project on Artificial Intelligence January 2020
- Solving the Game of “8 Tiles” using Offline Learning and Online Learning, separately.
- Ongoing: Solving the game with a grid size larger than 3 x 3 using Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Deep Learning Projects
RKMVERI, Belurmath and ISI, Kolkata August 2019 - November 2019
- Project 1: Using Spatial Transformer Network for handwritten digit recognition. Achieved an
accuracy of 99.14%.
- Project 2: Building a Neural Language model (using RNN, LSTM or GRU). Using this NL model,
various stories were combined to generate new stories.
 
- Project 3: Image Captioning: A state-of-the-art technique called the “Attention” mechanism
was used to generate captions for any arbitrary image.
An Exploratory and Predictive Analysis using Sparklyr and R
RKMVERI, Belurmath May 2019
- This Big Data Project was done based on Washington’s popular Bike Sharing program.
- Analysed number of biked shared, based on various weather conditions and seasons, and their evolution
over the years, considering the average rise in temperature of the city due to Global Warming.
 
Machine Learning
RKMVERI, Belurmath May 2019
- Opinion mining and Sentiment Analysis of people’s opinion on “What qualities are necessary to be-
come the Prime Minister of India?” It was an unsupervised approach and the task was accomplished
without using standard Machine Learning library.
 
Project intern at Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN)
ITT Indore January 2018
- Attended talks on “Economics of Science, Technology & Innovation: Empirical Approaches & RCTs”.
