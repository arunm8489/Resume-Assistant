Role | Machine Learning Engineer
TemSve
e Developed a high-quality ML Framework that
Responsibilities supports all Scikit-learn, classification models and
integrated and resolving issues.
   
With internal application to perform the training
and to get the Predictions in AWS. It helps in
identifying the Working and Non-Working
Sensors.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
Class Imbalance and Dimensionality reduction
while developing Machine Learning algorithms.
e Performed ML model deployment in AWS.
Description: - Wafer Sensor Detection is a project to build a classification methodology to
predict the quality of wafer sensors based on the given training data.
It is a major application which helps in detecting and managing the huge number of
sensors. Our team has automated Sensor detection through the ML framework.
