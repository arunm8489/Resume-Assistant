Hand Detection in Shredder machine:
- Shredder machine is used to crush the materials like paper, plastic, metals etc. If the hand crosses the safety limit, it
causes severe injury to hand and may lead to death in some cases. So in this project, main aim is to Detect the hand
crossing the safety limit of the Shredder machine. Whenever it crosses the safety limit, it generates an alarm and turn off
the machine immediately, so that major accident can be avoided.
Key tasks:
- Involved in understanding the business problem, Data collection, Model building and retraining the model.
- Object detection using SSD which detects hand / gloved hand.
Output: List of bounding boxes around each detected hand, distance line between hand and safety limit.
Skills employed: Python, Deep learning, CV2, SSD object detection
Customer Churn prediction:
- Churn modeling problem (any individual customer will leave the bank or stay). Current responsibilities include
understanding business problem, implementation the strategies and delivery of product while engaging the Lead through
constant feedback.
Key tasks:
- Involved in Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing and Feature engineering techniques for making the data useful to create
Machine learning models.
- Involved in creating various classification models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Built Machine learning models: Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
- Built Deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network) using Keras.
Skills employed: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, EDA, Machine Learning, ANN
