Experience
Konsultera Solutions Pvt Ltd March 2020 - Present.
Machine Learning Developer.
List of Projects:
1. End-To-End ID Card Data Extractor:
e Trained Id Card Detection model using TensorFlow YOLO-v3 architecture.
e Have Trained Id Card Field Detection model using TensorFlow YOLO-v3 Architecture.
e Retrained tesseract model for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
e Digital Image Tampering: Research and Developed Machine Learning Model for localizing
the forged region.
e Blurriness Detection: Performed binary classification using Machine Learning technique
such as SVM.
e Character Classification: Developed Convolutional Neural Network frameworks for
predicting single character image.
e Image Angle Detection: Developed Convolutional Neural Network frameworks performing
classification on the image angle, using Python and keras library. Leveraged weight matrix
of pre-trained models such as VGG, Inception & ResNet, performed hyper parameter tuning
to improve model’s performance.
e Image Denoise: Design and Developed CNN Autoencoder to eliminate noise from the image.
Used Ensemble technique with Autoencoder to train the model.
e Integrated Tesseract OCR by initially preforming different preprocessing technique using
OpenCV.
e Used Flask framework to develop entire backend modules in Python. Created independent
libraries in Python which can be used by multiple projects which have common
