Traffic Sign Classification:
e In self-driving cars the passenger can fully depend on the car for traveling. But to achieve level 5
autonomous, it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all traffic rules.
e Inthe world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big
companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on
autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles
should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.
e Inthis Python project, we build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in
the image into different categories. With this model, we can read and understand traffic signs which
are avery important task for all autonomous vehicles
e Tools used: Keras, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PIL and image classification.
e Role: Explore the dataset
Build a CNN model
Train and validate the model
