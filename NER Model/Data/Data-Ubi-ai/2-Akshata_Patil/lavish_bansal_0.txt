Model: Word2Vec, Text Rank Algorithm
Data Source: API
e Project: Answering System of similar question
Overview: This system identifies the similar question asked by different
client in shared location like confluence page and refer the already
available solution in the page.
Business Use Case: PM has to address number of queries and questions
asked by either customer or by GS team. Most of the time questions were
repetitive and to address their queries more effectively and in lesser time,
we have implemented this solution
