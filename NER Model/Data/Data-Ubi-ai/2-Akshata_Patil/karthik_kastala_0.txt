RECENT PROJECTS
PROJECT 1: Predicting CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) and Identifying Churn Customers.
Description: Worked for one of the leading UK based online gaming company. Their Business Problem is to predict Churners
because most of the players are churners after their first APD(Active Player Day).
Roles & Responsibilities:
> Converting Business Problem into Statistical Problem, Data Cleaning and EDA.
> Using statistical methods to overcome Business Problem.
> Plotting graphs for visualizing results? Storing results in a client database.
> Recommendations for retaining potential churn customers.
We have used RFM Analysis and Logistics Regression to solve business problems. RFM Analysis helps to identify different
customers Segments and Logistic Regression helps to Predicting Churn Customers.
PROJECT 2: Bet Amount, NGR Value Weekly Forecasting and Recommendation Systems.
Description: Worked for UK based company and business objective is to forecast Bet Amount, NGR value on Weekly basis and
Recommendation for new players.
Roles & Responsibilities:
> Data Cleaning and Data Analysis.
> Plotting graphs for understanding data more clearly and easily.
> Time Series Forecasting for Forecasting Weekly Bet Amount and NGR Value.
> Dynamic Recommendation System.
We have used deep learning technique (LSTM) for forecasting Bet Amount and NGRValue and model accuracy is very good
with a MAPE of 5%. Used Collaborative Filtering for Recommendation System using data at customer Level and Game Level.
