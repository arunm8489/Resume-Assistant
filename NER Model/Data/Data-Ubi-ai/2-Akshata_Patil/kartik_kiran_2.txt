3.Text classification using BERT (internship Project): In this project we are trying to
classify the text , in previous methods like LSTM and RNN we are not able to understand the context
(meaning) of text hence sometime it is hard for classification . But in this project we are using
Transformers based NLP state of the art models which is able to understand context from both
direction of sentence . So it is robust in classification , I'm using pytorch and BERT-small uncased
model for model making and performing EDA using sklearn library this is project is under construction
ROLE 1) gathered Data from Kaggle 2) text preprocessing (stopword removal ) 3) use skearn to
perform train test split 4) use pretrained BERT TOKENIZER to tokenize the text 5) Use [CLS] , [SEP ]
[MASK ]tokens for data processing .creating Encoding od the data and covert text features to
encoding 5) choose the max length and sentence . sentences which are small than max length are
padded with zero in the end and sentence bigger than max length are Chop off 5) creating a pytorch
dataLoder class to load the data
Recommendation Engine (ongoing internship project): created a recommendation
Engine using user - user similarity which can be used for similar product recommendation In this
project | used , content based , user-user and Item-item similarity approach , | used Matrix
factorization And Singular Value decomposition for Dimensionality reduction
ROLE: this model can be used for different-different use cases with some tuning( for similar product
suggestion and songs of movie recommendation) 1) gathered the data 2) done data preprocessing
calculate text similarity 3) use cosine similarity and pairwise distance to calculate text similarity 4)
remove duplicates text 5) removed outliers 6) convert high amount of data to low amount by
converting 2D array to sparse array using SciPy (32 GB to approx 1.5 GB 7) convert text to vectors
using TF-IDF and Word2Vec and calculate similarity between then 8) used KNN for choosing same
products
