PROJECT PROFILE
At Inteliment Technologies — for Magna Internationals
End of line test optimization of vehicle power transmission.
> Built ML model that predicts transmission box will pass EOL test on
process measurement data collected at assembly stations.
Gear honing tool usage optimization of power transmission.
> Built ML models for gear quality prediction and dynamically redressing
honing tool to optimize the tool utilization.
Vibration analysis of gear grinding operation
> Built ML models for gear grinding operation to predict gear quality to
reduce end-of-line test failures.
Vehicle Field Data Analytics
> Build end-to-end data traceability pipeline & correlation for power
transmission. Here, manufacturing data and field data from OEM is
considered for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis, Topic modelling and Text summarization of survey
data and Automobile news.
> Sentiment analysis of text feedback in survey data is used for continuous
improvement in service across various functional areas and geographical
regions. This service was utilized in dashboard of survey data.
> Tomake informed business decisions, the subjective information from
the text is extracted using sentiment analysis, topic modelling and
summary reports from the news that gets publish every day on
Automobile news.
