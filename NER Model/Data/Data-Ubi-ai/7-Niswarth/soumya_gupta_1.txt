3. Implemented SGD with L2 regularization and Bootstrap Aggregation in Python right
from scratch i.e. without using Scikit-Learn libraries.
4. Used k-means clustering to characterize customers segment of population, and to
build a model that will be able to predict customers for Arvato Financial Solutions.
Report Generation:-
