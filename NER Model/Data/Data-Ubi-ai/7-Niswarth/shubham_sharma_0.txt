WORK EXPERIENCE
Software Developer
Wipro limited
06/2019 - Present
Developed a SOAR web application which is a platform for complete lifecycle
management of security incidents, alerts, and service requests.
Tasks
fo)
fo)
Automated the service requests and security tickets using a Flask-based web
microservice which included various operations like predicting classification,
priority, severity, etc. of the tickets, triaging them, and recommending various
solutions to resolve them improving the performance of real-time business
activity monitoring report and reducing the report response time by more
than 50%.
Solely Developed a microservice to perform malware analysis on suspicious
items which included executable files, pdf, word documents, etc using
predictive modeling, post conducting an in-depth study of the gap between
the ideal and on-ground practices for malicious activity detection.
Implemented and administered Auto creation of workflow using a brief
description which helped to decrease the dependency upon knowing the
code. It included various grammar rules written in spacy and embedding
techniques like word2vec, tfidf, and pre-trained embeddings to find the
similarity.
Designed a platform using python to develop/train various machine learning
models, data preprocessing, and visualization features enabling end-users to
onboard new metrics into the self-serve data system and experimentation
platform.
Implemented solution recommendations for an incident ticket which
recommended top results after analyzing the ticket and the past analyst
choices were also taken into account while giving the recommendations.
Translate operator business objectives into business intelligence trough
regressive data analytics
Develop and improve predictive models to optimize the user experience and
operational efficiency.
Actively participated and contributed to the internal Al initiatives.
