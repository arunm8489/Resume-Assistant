BACHELOR OF TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
Guru Gobind Indraprastha University (GGSIPU)- MAIT, Delhi | 2010 -
2014
Done my graduation in computer science engineering.
PROJECTS ON AI/ML
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF TWITTER TWEETS
e Implemented BERT and other attention models to classify sentiments of
different tweets extracted
e -ntegrated an intelligent chatbot that accommodates for differences in syntax
of the questioning grammar
e Designed UI using Angular and deployed on AWS using Docker and EC2
buckets.

Audio Finger Printing
e Spectrogram of the songs are created
e peaks from the spectrogram are used to create hashcodes for
the song and saved to a database
e These hash codes are the identifiers for the songs
e backend is deployed to VM
e socket programming is used to send the new song recording
for detection.
STOCKS PREDICTION USING GENETIC ALGORITHM AND DECISION
TREE
e Developed an intelligent stock price prediction system which helped in
enabling the user to understand the visibility into the following day’s stock
price trend using Decision Tree and Genetic Algorithm
e The interface was designed using Angular and was deployed on AWS using
docker and glassfish services

IMAGE CLASSIFICATION FOR HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY FOOD
e Created the image dataset using a web crawler
e Build different deep learning models from scratch using TensorFlow
Keras.
e Experimented with different hyperparameters to get the best results
SIMILAR IMAGES PREDICTION
e Trained autoencoder to encode images of the dataset using Pytorch.
e Performed experiments by tuning hyperparameters to achieve the
best encoding.
e Applied the encoded output to train the KNN model to find the 5
nearest neighbors to each image.
