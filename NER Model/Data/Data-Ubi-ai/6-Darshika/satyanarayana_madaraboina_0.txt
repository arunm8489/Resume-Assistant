KEY PROJECTS
Domain: Electronics-consumer | Tech Stack: Python| JAN'20
e Objective: To develop a feature which recognise five different gestures performed by
the user that help users control the Smart-TV without using a remote.
e Solution: Convolution 3D and CNN LSTM neural networks are modeled to predict the
user control based on the recognised user gesture.
e Key Achievement: Experimented Convolution 3D and Convolution LSTM models with
different filter sizes, number of layers,dropout and various parameters.CNN-LSTM
outperformed CNN 3D model for gesture recognition with training accuracy of 88%
and validation accuracy of 73%.
KEY PROJECTS
Domain: Hospitality | Tech Stack: Python| JAN'20
e Objective: To help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a
good restaurant discovery experience
e Solution: Build conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants
across several Indian cities
e Key Achievement:Able to develop a chatbot which gives users top 10 restaurants with
rating,reviews and the cuisines,cost of cuisines available in tier-1 and tier-2 restaurants
based on user inputs.
KEY PROJECTS
Domain: Travel | Tech Stack: Python| JAN'20
e Objective:To build an RL-based algorithm which can help cab drivers maximise their
profits by improving their decision-making process on the field.
e Solution: Taking long-term profit as the goal, we proposed Markov Decision Process
based on reinforcement learning to optimize taxi driving strategies for profit
maximisation
e Key Achievement: created an environment and a RL agent that is trained using vanilla
Deep Q-learning (DQN) which learns to choose the best request from the pool of
requests a cab driver receives.We are able to achieve a good convergence rate for
agent with optimal Q-Value.
