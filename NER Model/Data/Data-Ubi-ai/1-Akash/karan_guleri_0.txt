KEY ACADEMIC PROJECTS
NOISE FILTERING FROM AUDIO USING ANN Mentor: Dr. Vinay K. Jadoun (Aug’17 — Nov’17)
— Objective: To separate audio vocals from the mixture of vocals and background noise
— Designed Multi layered Neural Network and Implemented Back propagation algorithm in Octave for model, Led a team of 5 members
— Created an application that could be trained using data sets for solving the problem
AIR-O-DRUM Mentor: Mr.Amit Puri (Apr’17-May’17)
— Objective: To create a sensor this plays the drums and piano on the computer screen through webcam while moving your hands.
Proposed and developed the algorithm to detect a particular color in the sensor and to play the particular sound using Open CV and Python, the
model works well for the Linux and windows platform, Led a team of 4members
