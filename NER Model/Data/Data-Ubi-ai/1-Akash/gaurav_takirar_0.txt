Experienced and driven data scientist with 1.5 years of experience in the industry as a Data
Scientist.
Project : Predicting Potential Customers for the new Bancassurance product using Cluster
Analysis, extracted data from past products sold(2007-2019) & train the model.
Solution : Worked with the product, marketing & Big data team to fetch required data.
To overcome effects of imbalanced sets Sampling techniques were applied.
Clustering, Regression & Random forest were applied to get the desired outputs
Each of the algorithms prediction, accuracy, precision & recall were compared.
Result : Get precision of 89% & Recall>90%
Project : Face Mask Classifier for a Firm to auto differentiate & make there employees follow
COVID protocols & to make working environment efficient & COVID free.
Solution : Set Containing 3 classes (with mask, without a mask, and wearing mask incorrectly)
improve the dataset, augment images in such a way that each class has an equal distribution of
images and removing noisy images which could be considered as outliers.
Train it using Deep learning algorithm - CNN(Convolutional neural network)
Result : Get accuracy of 88% by using different optimizers & tuning increased it to 93.5%.
Project : Designed a regression model for an online food ordering company to increase
incentives for delivery boy during peak ordering hours resulting in a 14% increase in delivery boy
availability during peak ordering times.
Solution : Get the desired data of the weekends, peak usually occurs at that phase.
Feature Selection & specified grouping for the places where requirement of delivery boy usually
raises.
Created a model to raise specified incentives & increase delivery boy availability.
Result : Get the problem resolved & also gets appreciation from the Client.
