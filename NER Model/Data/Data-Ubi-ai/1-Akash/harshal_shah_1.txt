PROJECTS
Generic Sentiment Analysis Tool for Analyzing Reviews (Python, Flask) Jun 2020 — Jul 2020
e Created a generic model to scrape reviews from travel websites to assess reviewer’s sentiments and recommend
prospective customers accordingly
e The Decision Tree classifier was used to categorize reviews as Positive, Negative and Neutral along with the Text Blob
Library and accomplished an overall accuracy of 77%
e Delivered entire project to the client after deploying on the web operating on Python’s Flask
Climate Misinformation Detection System (Python) May 2020 — Jun 2020
e Worked on the collection of data for climate change information & misinformation leveraging BeautifulSoup and
Scrapy libraries in python
e Applied text processing techniques in NLP and generated features from text deploying Vectorisation methods
e Proposed various Machine Learning models such as SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Deep Learning
models such as RNN, LSTM to restrict texts as ‘Climate Change Information’ and ‘Climate Change Misinformation’
e Succeeded best results (85% percent approx.) using the Logistic Regression model along with TF-IDF, N-gram level
vectorised features
City Analytics on the Cloud (Python & Cloud) Apr 2019 — May 2019
e Devised a tweet harvesting system by accessing Twitter API and managed to store tweets to CouchDB cluster with the
help of Tweepy and CouchDB libraries in python
