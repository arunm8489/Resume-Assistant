WORK EXPERIENCE
Software Engineer
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
11/2020 - 02/2022 Noida, India
- Working extensively on databases. Handling monthly runs of critical projects.
Optimized scripts by using better SQL hints to cut down on script runtime by 70%.
- Working on data preparation for the machine learning models. Also working on data
analysis to find the relationship between large datasets.
Junior Machine Learning Engineer
Omdena
04/2021 - 07/2021 Remote
- Developed a regression model to predict the ROI of a building when the existing
lighting system is upgraded to a new cost-efficient lighting system. “
- Filling missing values in features by KNN imputation. Predicting ROI for the
buildings using a random forest regressor.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to get the best parameter values. Achieved an
accuracy of 82% on the test data and an r2 score of 0.86.
Python Instructor

12/2020 - 04/2021 Remote
- Led aclassroom of students from class 8th to 12th on the basics of python
programming.
Data Engineering Intern
Convosight
03/2020 - 04/2020 Delhi, India
- Worked on data warehousing, wrote scripts for mass extraction of data, and updated
redshift and other warehouses.
PROJECTS
Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction (11/2021 - 12/2021) @
— Developed a binary classification model with Gradient Boosting as a baseline model to predict
if existing policyholders in an insurance company would be receptive to buy vehicle insurance.
— Target encoding to handle features with large number of categories and one hot encoding the
remaining categories.
— Class imbalance was observed, for every sample of ‘customer is interested’, 7.15 samples of
‘not interested’ are available. Used SMOTE boosting to oversample the minority class.
— Achieved an improved accuracy of 84% ROC-AUC score on the test set with hyper-tuned LGBM
classifier applied on PCA data do as to remove overfitting.
— Applied SHAP and ELI5 plots such as dependence plots to understand feature interactions and
summary plots to identify the important factors responsible for customer involvement.
Ted Talk Views Prediction (10/2021 - 11/2021) ¢@
— Developed a regression model using Gradient Boosting algorithm to estimate the number of
views on TED video with a MAPE score of 38% on the test set.
— Used Google's pre-trained Word2Vec model to vectorize 'Transcript' feature in the dataset
which held the maximum amount of textual information.
— Implemented IQR method to filter out outliers from numerical features and tuned the hyper-
parameters of the model using GridSearchCV.
— Applied SHAP to understand important features influencing views taking XGBOOST as
baseline model.
Malaria Classification (09/2021 - 10/2021) @
— Developed an image classification model with pretrained VGG19 on Malaria patient images to
identify presence of malaria in the patient.
— Performed data augmentation using techniques like: rotation, translation, zooming, cropping,
and flipping.
- Achieved an improved accuracy of 94% with pretrained VGG19 on test data over baseline
model developed using standard CNN's.
