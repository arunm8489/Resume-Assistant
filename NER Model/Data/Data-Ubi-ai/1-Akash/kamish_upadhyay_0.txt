WORK EXPERIENCE
TCS Research | 3 years Bengaluru, KA
Applied Machine Learning Engineer Feb 2019 — Present
e Digital Twin: Developed machine learning algorithms and implemented research papers from scratch for
Comprehensive data quality verification, Automatic data preprocessing, Auto ML and few more classic ML/DL
nodes. Did A/B testing & analysis of ML models and optimizing models for accuracy.
e AI Chatbot: Developed a query chatbot leveraged NLP for issue searching on Django framework. Handled
large-scale training & prediction of ML models with Hadoop/Spark distributed computing systems. The next
word prediction for the chatbot was also developed using keras sequential model LSTM, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
@ BFSI Domain: Developed kernel with an accuracy of 96.271% by which classification of genuine customers for
the banking/financial policies was easier. This improved their reach out to customers & also maintained their
strong customer relationships by 27%. Did end-to-end system design, data analysis, feature engineering,
technique selection & implementation, debugging, and maintenance in production.
