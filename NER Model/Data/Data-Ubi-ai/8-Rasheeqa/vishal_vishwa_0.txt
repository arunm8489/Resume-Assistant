e Manipulating. cleansing & processing data using Excel and SQL.
e Responsible for loading, extracting and validation of client data.
e Analyzing raw data drawing conclusions & drawing recommendations.
e Advising on the suitability of methodologies and suggesting improvements
Projects:
e Customer Segmentation:
Problem Statement: Identifying Customer Segments with high likelihood of Conversion for Loan offers.
Insight: Gathered data from multiple sources including sales and customer databases to create integrated view that helped in
increasing that accuracy from 88% to 93%.
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, scikit-learn
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Categorical attributes visualization using countplot
Numerical attributes visualization using distplot
Model: LogisticRegression and DecisionTreeClassifier
Interpretation: Confusion Matrix, roc_curve
e Loan Prediction Analysis: Accuracy 83%
Problem Statement: A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not.
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, scikit-learn
Preprocessing the dataset:
Find the null values
Fill the missing values for numerical terms — mean and for categorical terms - mode
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Categorical attributes visualization using countplot
Numerical attributes visualization using distplot
Feature Engineering: Log Transformation, Correlation Matrix, Label Encoding,
Model: LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, Random Forest, Hyperparameter tuning
Interpretation: Confusion Matrix
