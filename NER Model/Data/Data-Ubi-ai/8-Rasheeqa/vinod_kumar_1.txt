e Applied various machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and develop a model to predict the future
e Used some metric or combination of metrics to "measure" objective performance of model
e Tested the model against previously unseen data
Hyperparameter Tuning
e Tuning model parameters for improved performance
e Simple model hyperparameters may include: number of training steps, learning rate, initialization values and distribution,
etc.
7 KEY PROJECTS
PROJECT 1: Prediction Of Compressive Strength Of Concrete.
Brief: The goal is to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on given attributes .
e Created a Machine Learning Regression model to analyze datasets containing attributes like cement, fly ash, water,
blast furnace slag, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, etc.
PROJECT 2: Telecom Churn Prediction
Brief: Make predictions which customer will switch to other telecom service providers, based on the relevant customer data.
e Created a Machine Learning Classification model to analyze datasets containing attributes like voice mail plan, total
call duration, call charge, customer service calls, etc.
PROJECT 3: Diabetes Prediction
Brief: Make predictions based on the patient's characteristic data set to predict whether s/he is diabetic or not
e Created a Machine Learning model to analyze datasets containing attributes like glucose level, blood pressure, age, etc.
PROJECT 4: Twitter Analytics
Brief: Deploy social media analytics to measure, analyze & interpret interactions & associations between people, topics &
ideas
e Captured a dataset via Live Twitter Streaming for further analysis
e Performed Sentiment Analysis on the tweets obtained for visualizing the conclusion
PROJECT 5: Air Passengers Forecasting
Brief: Analyze the data and apply time series modelling to forecast the number of expected bookings for each month
e Analyzed the dataset containing monthly totals of international airline passengers between 1949 to 1960
e Rendered assistance to the management for making informed decisions w.r.t staffing, hospitality and ticket pricing
