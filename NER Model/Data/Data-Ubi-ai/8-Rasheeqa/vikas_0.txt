PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Machine Learning Engineer Jun'16 - Present
Tata Consultancy Services Bangalore
Responsibilities and Key Learning
e Performed preliminary analysis, EDA, Descriptive Stats. on a data volume of 5 Lacs
odd rows & visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn
e Created BI dashboards using Tableau for various KPls and successfully automated
the same
e Handled data imbalance, performed feature engineering and feature selection
to make the data fit for model building
e Analyzed problem solving capabilities of ML/DL algorithms on business cases
and rank them based on there performance.
e Improved model performance though various Hyperparameter Optimization
techniques.
 
Projects:
Complaint Categorization
e Segregated complaints based on respective complaints category
e Reduced time/effort and human errors were eliminated by automating the
segregation
e Developed model using NLP to tokenize the text and algorithm used was Naive
Bayes
Determination of strength of surgical cement
e Instituted model to predict bone cement Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)
strength
e Prepared data for building regression model
e Developed and tested regression models and XGboost turns out to be most
efficient.
Sentiment Analysis
e Data Cleaning - Converting unstructured into structured data using Python
e Preparation and conversion of text data into vector notation though one hot
encoding and prepared the embedded layer.
e Used CNN and LSTM for model building as the accuracy obtained was close to
96%.
Customer Behavioral analytics for a Bike Showroom for determining window
shopping customers
e Identification of key parameters leading to bike purchase
e Cleaned and pre-processed Data for building classification model.
e Built and Tested-Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM etc.
e Formulated a machine learning model for determining probability of purchase
e Analyzed and performed evaluation on Models for best classification Accuracy
Other Projects
e Designed Recommendation system for users using K Means clustering for a
audio streaming company.
e Constructed classification model to predict the chances of stroke based on the
given health conditions.
