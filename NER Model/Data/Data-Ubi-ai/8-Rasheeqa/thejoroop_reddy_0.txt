PROJECTS
Semiconductor manufacturing process
Objective: Build a classifier to predict the Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity and analyse whether all the features are
required to build the model or not
Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random forest, AdaBoost, GradientBoost
Random forest performed well compared with other algorithms
Cross validation and GridSearchCV yielded better results
Model deployment using flask
Telecom Churn
The project is done by using ensemble models and it is a classification problem
Objective: Build a model that will identify the potential customers who have a higher probability to churn.
Algorithms used: Decision Tree, Random forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Tree Boosting
Gradient boosting performed well compared with other Algorithms with score of 82.45
