The project aim is to detection of brain tumor in early stages of cancer. This
application is used by physicists to get better/precise idea about brain tumor
with 87.69% accuracy. Currently working on increasing the accuracy by
using Deep Learning techniques on GPUs.
Data scientist
Involve in Data pre-processing stage which involves cleaning of
MRI images by using median filter in MATLAB, R and Python
Created various data frames from the MRI images using R
Image segmentation and Object Labeling done by using MATLAB and
feature matrices extracted in R, Python
Used data imputation techniques for missing data using R,Python
Involved in coming up with various visualizations using ggplot package
Involved in cleaning up various discrepancies in data to make it analysis
ready using R and Python
Analyzed and prepared with patterns of classified data, made a model to
test new data for prediction
Analyzed and used advanced analytical techniques such as Logistic
Regression, Decision Tree, Random forests, SVM in comparing the
accuracies that help in decision making of analyst to detect type of tumor
exists in patient’s brain

Python, machine learning , Deep Learning, Artificial Neural Networks.
There are many tasks in the ecommerce industry that require cognitive tasks
such as categorization of millions of products sold Online.
The aim is to develop a model to correctly classify the product according to
its attributes
This would help optimizing product taxonomy and hence ensure that
customers can browse through
Online product catalogs smoothly.
data scientist
Website Breadcrumb , Inode Breadcrumb.
Taking the Product Name and Website Breadcrumb as input, we have to
predict the Inode Breadcrumb.
Removing the brand names
Also some other product features like Brand, Color,
Description, Image URL are available, some of which can used for
Classification .
Initially we had tried classifying using machine learning algorithms like
SVM, Naive bayes etc ()
