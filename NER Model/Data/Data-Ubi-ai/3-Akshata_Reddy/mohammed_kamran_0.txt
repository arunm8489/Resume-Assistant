Machine Learning Intern
¢ Applied various machine learninglibraries and algorithms for different datasets.
¢ Developed a Voice Assistant by name — Jessica, during learning process.
¢ Adapted existing datasets and improved their accuracy by applying different algorithms.
¢ Created charts in Jupyter Notebook to perform preliminary analysis & visualize data using Matplotlib, Seaborn.
¢ Worked on various datasets during the internship period such as House Price Prediction, Handwritten Digit
Recognition, Heart Disease, Titanic Data sets, Hr Analytics, Diabetics Data set, MNIST etc
Projects
Titanic Dataset — Kaggle
Collected the dataset and explored it, checked about missing values and learned which features are important. For
data visualization used Seaborn and Matplotlib. During the data pre-processing part, computed missing values, converted
features into numeric ones, grouped values into categories and created a few new features. Then trained the dataset using
different machine learning algorithms and predicted the accuracy of 98.2 %.
