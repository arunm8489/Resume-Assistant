Project 4: Customer Medical Insurance Claim Prediction
Project Description: The aim was to develop a risk predict model based on the demographic information
and pre-existing diseases given by the customer to decide the premium and design policies accordingly.
Roles and Responsibilities:
e Analyzed the modelling data using data mining techniques, including dimensionality reduction,
data enhancement and data transformations.
e Managed imbalanced data by using imbalanced techniques like oversampling and under sampling
and SMOTE.
e Performed Predictive Modelling for predicting claim of customer with different demographics and
pre-existing conditions.
e Build a best fit model using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random
Forest).
e Evaluated the model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1 score & AUC-ROC
Curve.
Educational Qualifications:
e Completed B Tech (Electronics and Communication Engineering) from Meenakshi College Of
Engineering, ANNA University in the year 2012.
