Email Spam/Non-Spam Dataset
The spam classification system is created to identify the spam and non-spam mails. Here I have used the Naive Bayesian
Classifier and extracted the words using word-count algorithm. After calculation, found that the naive Bayesian classifier
error rate is very low and it has classified the emails appropriately into spam and non-spam.
HR Analytics Dataset

people are leaving the company.
