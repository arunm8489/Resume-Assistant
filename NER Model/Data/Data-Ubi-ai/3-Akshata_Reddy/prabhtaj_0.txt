e@ eE-KYC
Client - Prudential PLC
A project spanning across a set of backend ML/AI services and edge Al models driving decision metrics for a complete eKYC module
for an insurance application
Tasks-
O Developed edge Al models for Image Classification, categorizing images into ID / Non-ID and into known ID types
and Heatmap Regression based Landmark Localizer for document auto-cropping
Implemented React Native component for Real-Time Blink Detection, Iris Tracking and Facial Orientation Estimation
O Developed a React-Native component for inferencing Facial Recognition/Verification results using TensorflowJS and
MobileNet architecture for matching faces between PhotolDs and real-time Video
e ID-OCR
Client - Prudential PLC
This project enables Information retrieval from Identity Cards and Documents of thirteen countries and a total of thirty distinct ID
types, serving as backend for multiple Sign-up, Verification and enrollment journeys in three different applications
Tasks-
O Developed a DL model using Transfer Learning to categorize input images into ID, Photocopy or Non-I!D (ID-Detect)
O Developed DL models using Transfer Learning to classify an ID image into known ID types for various countries
(ID-Classify)
O Developed Heatmap Regression based |D-card Landmark Localizer to detect the 4 corners of an ID / Document in an
image to facilitate auto-cropping
e@ Ro es & RESPONSIBILITIES
O Define AP! Architectural Design and Pipelines (end-to-end Solution Architecture) for Al/ML services
oO Identify areas of improvement in existing services and investigate new technologies for the same
O Incorporation of developed models into scalable production-grade APIs and deployment on AKS
O Owned full responsibility of developing CI/CD pipelines, migrating and modifying PROD and UAT clusters
© Actively collaborated with stakeholders to improve the developed APIs and modules

e ID-OCR
Client - Prudential PLC
This project enables Information retrieval from Identity Cards and Documents of thirteen countries and a total of thirty distinct ID
types, serving as a backend for multiple Sign-up, Verification and enrollment journeys in three different applications
Tasks-
O Developed a Config driven backend service to extract information from ID images of various countries using OCR
Implemented Redis Caching for updating API configurations, taking effect without the need to deploy the APIs
O
O Implemented a Metric for Reference-less text quality in ID images as proposed in CG-DIQA ‘18 (Hongyu Li et al.)
O
Developed an Image Processing based ID Background removal algorithm for crop-aligned ID cards along with other
image enhancement techniques to enhance OCR capture accuracy
oO Increased Image Processing API throughput by leveraging GPUs for number crunching, resulting in a multi-fold
performance increase (Image-Match)
