PERSONAL PROJECTS
COVID-19 DETECTION USING X-RAY IMAGES
(04/2021 - 05/2021)
e@ The objective of this project is to identify whether a person is COVID
+ given his X-ray image (posteroanterior view) available.
Data collected from IEEE hosted GITHUB folio and Kaggle. Cross-
referenced the image using a function and filtered out only the
images where RT-PCR test came out as positive after testing and
only the posteroanterior view of the images as in Normal X-ray
dataset we have only posteroanterior image.
Model is a traditional CNN with 3 Conv layers, all having pooling
layers and ReLU as activation function. A dropout of 0.25 has been
added to all the three dense layers in order to remove overfitting.
The output layer has a single neuron unit with sigmoid function.

BIKE BUYER'S PREDICTION (08/2020 - 09/2020)
@ Learned the importance of Data wrangling by cleaning the raw data
with missing value imputation techniques which helped us in
obtaining better features. Data visualization and storytelling helped
us in gaining better understanding of the data. We used Univariate,
Bivariate and multivariate analysis to explore the hidden insights.
Used k-NN and Decision Tree Classification algorithm for model.
