advancing in research.
Work Experience (4 years }
Software Engineer — Samsung Electromechanics 2019- present
SEMPRO-AI : It is a platform to for security operations like:
1) Trespassing detection: It detects person, animal and drone
trying to get inside the factory using object detection. It also
detects human shadows.
2) Crowd detection: It detects if more than the specified number
of people are standing in an area.
3) Machine open door: It detects if some server door is left open
in the room.
4) Kiosk: It detects whether a worker is wearing the security kit
properly or not, while entering the factory.
POCs:
1) Moving object detection : It detects moving objects in a live
environment with moving camera. It uses context based
HOOFs implemented in tensorflow.
2) Data theft prevention: It detects a mobile phone camera and
creates a screen blackout if someone tries to take a picture of
their computer screen.
Machine Learning Engineer — Wipro Ltd. 2016- 2019
EDR Solution Development using Machine Learning : Single handedly
developed an Al based EDR solution under the guidance of the Head of
Security (Wipro). The solution would detect anomaly in the entire
network.
Auto Test Script Generator Bot : It uses Natural language processing to
convert the Natural language into commands and then converts it into
Selenium script for testing web based applications.
Awards & Achievements
Received two awards in Wipro for taking special initiatives and for
significant contribution to the team.
