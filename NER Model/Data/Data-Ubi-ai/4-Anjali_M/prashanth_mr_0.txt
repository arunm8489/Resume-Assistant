AI based supplier quotation evaluation and supplier selection
This is an innovative effort from the company to automate the process of
supplier quotation evaluation which currently cannot be done without the
presence of human intuition and it also deals with the algorithm to select the
best supplier
The data lake consists of the following file formats like pdf ,excel ,word
and ppt from which data is extracted
The data then is translated to a structured database using NLP based
techniques.
Deep learning algorithm is applied on the structured data to come up
with a deep learning model which will be able to estimate the supplier
quotation based on its learning.
Future plan is to use this data to select the supplier using
reinforcement learning algorithm
Tools used: Pycharm, Excel VBA ,chamelot and tabula for pdf,
openpyexcel for excel,keras,nltkynumpy ,pandas etc
