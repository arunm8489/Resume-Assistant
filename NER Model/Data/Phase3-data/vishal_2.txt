Description > This project deals with trauma cases coming to the hospital for treatment.
The main objective is to find out the relationship and association between
injury types. By using these hidden relations, associations & patterns
doctors/physicians recommend different tests and scanning
 
 
 
 
Key > Cleaned & transformed the data to do required analysis (By using
Responsibiliti “dplyr’”, “tidyr” packages)
es > Performed chi-square test analysis to check tests of independence
Used supervised & unsupervised modeling techniques using R/Python
VV
Built multiple models to predict injury types & cause of death by using
“caret” package
Created ensemble models with Decision trees, Random Forest, Bagging
Boosting algorithms to get high model performance(GBM)
Performed Classification using Deep Learning, Artificial Neural Networks
Performed AUC & ROC analysis of models built
Compared classification models with Logistic, Decision trees, Random
Forests, & SVM techniques
> Handled over plotting by using certain ways with ggplot2
VV VV WV
> Created various functions, which will give detailed summary reports
Used R markdown to turn analyses into high quality documents,
reports, presentations and dashboards.
