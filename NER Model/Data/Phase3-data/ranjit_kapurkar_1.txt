Image Caption Generator:
Describing what’s in an image is an easy task for humans but for computers, an image is just a bunch
of numbers that represent t the colour value of each pixel. So, this is a difficult task for computers to
understand what is in the image and then generating the description in Natural language like English
is another difficult task.
Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language processing
concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a natural language like English.
This project uses deep learning techniques where we implement a Convolutional neural network
(CNN) with Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to build the image caption generator.

Automatic Essay Grading:
Automated essay scoring (AES) is the use of specialized computer programs to assign grades to
essays written in an educational setting. Its objective is to classify a large set of textual entities into a
small number of discrete categories, corresponding to the possible grades — for example, the
numbers 1 to 6. Therefore, it can be considered a problem of classification
