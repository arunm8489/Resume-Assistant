Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning
This project looks into various Python based Machine learning and data
Science libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Sciket-learn in an
attempt to build a machine leaning model capable of predicting the future
sale price of Bulldozers given its characteristics and previous examples of
how much similar bulldozers have been sold for.
