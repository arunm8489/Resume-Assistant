Education
Master of Computer Applications, Savitribai Phule Pune University 2086 ~ 2019
e CGPA: 8.4/10
e Academic Projects:
O Grid Detection - Implemented a 2D version of DBSCAN, a data clustering algorithm to separate lines and noise.
Detected structures made up of a series of intersecting lines (continuous or broken) from an image
Communicator.hs - Wrote a Haskell module to enable Inter-Process Communication using either Sockets or Files.
Image Similarity Index Calculator - Built a Python Application to calculate a similarity Index between two images
using SSIM and Hamming distance.
Oo Trapland - A Multiplayer console code-game consisting of programmable bots which roam a grid attempting to cover
the most area. Uses Communicator.hs and a custom interpreter for bot programs.
O P2P Ad-Hoc Chat - Implemented a protocol to achieve synchronization among nodes (in ad-hoc mode) in a network.
Implemented automatic node discovery, DFS for sending messages and message store for offline nodes
e Achievements:
Oo Ranked 2nd in Batch
© Actively participated in technical events and fests
e Research:
© AnakDHT - Proposed protocol for implementing a highly scalable (2'*8 nodes) Distributed Hash Table which improved
upon the scalability of Tapestry DHT while remaining as efficient and retaining the self-healing properties
