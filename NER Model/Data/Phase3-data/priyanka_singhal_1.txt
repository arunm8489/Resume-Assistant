any hard parts ( sewn edges), extra material(sleeves, collars). Second project
was to identify the fiber type of the cloth using NIR scanner to scan the cloth
and third was to identify the color of the cloth using machine learning and
computer vision
Concepts and technologies used:
e Python3, openCV
e Morphological transformation for Background Subtraction, Linear
Regression.

Al Research Intern - Facial Expression Recognition
May, 2017 - July 2017
Build a model which classifies human emotions & it also deals with the
problem of optimally detecting humans and its face in the given video
and identifying the faces. Build using following tools and concepts
e python3, tensorflow
e Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), LBPH and haar features.
PROJECTS
Face recognition using eigen face
Oct 2017 - Nov 2017
Worked on face detection and classification problems. EigenFace with
PCA used for feature extraction and build a machine learning model
using OpenCV and Python.
Automatic Speaker Recognition System
March 2017 - May 2017
This system made in this project is capable of identifying the speaker.
Registered speakers provide a given utterance and the system verifies
the speaker by accepting or rejecting the identity claim of a speaker.
Two algorithms are used-
1. MFCC
2. VQ(Vector Quantization) using LBG
Human Detection & Recognition
May 2016 - June 2016
Worked on the problems of human detection, face detection, and face
recognition in a video using following technologies and concepts:
e Python3, Opencv,
e SVM, HOG, Haar features, LBPH features and background
subtraction algorithm.
