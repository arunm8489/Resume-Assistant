Production Projects
Projectl):
Product name : FaceOpen
Company : Techolution
Details : Touch Free Door Open and Unlock Technology
Tools and Technique used _ : Python, OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow on GPU, PyTorch, Numpy,
Pandas, Sklearn(Scikit-learn), Matplotlib, Seaborn, CUDA, NVIDIA Drivers, Intel Realsense
Depth Camera, opencv2, pyrealsense2.
Architectures used : Transfer Learning, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, DenseNet169,
ResNet50, VGG16, NASNet, Efficient Net, Inception, FeatherNetB, YOLO, ImageNet.
Faceopen is designed to prevent face spoofing. Our 3D face liveness detection technique
powered by artificial intelligence rejects printed photographs or images shown on digital
devices, reducing security threats and the risk of unauthorized entry.
