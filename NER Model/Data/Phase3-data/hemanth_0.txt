PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE :
MulticoreWare | DATA SCIENTIST
JUN 2019 - Till Date
e We Efficiently relied on Convolutional neural network to solve ADAS, Security,
Surveillance, Robotics with the help of Computer Vision, and Machine learning
state of art technique.We enable everything in Low power Embedded ,and GPU
Hardware.Our Development Solutions are in Strict Specification.
e Microscopic image segmentation for medical image analysis. We Used Systematic
cancer detection algorithms which developed to enable the automation of
detection as per user eye sight.
e Research and Development of various Deep Learning and Machine learning
algorithms for business prediction modelling with cutting edge state of art of
ML/DL techniques Worked on classification, Clustering, Instance image
Segmentation, Computer Vision.
INFERIGENCE QUOTIENT | COMPUTER VISION INTERN
MAY 2018 - AUG 2018
e Working on Cutting edge computer vision Problems using Image Processing
Techniques with Python , OpenCV tools. Automated the process of extracting
3D Depth information from Images ,process was named Stereo Imaging.
¢ Develop Solution Ideas with given object and constraints.And Applied
Exploratory analysis on Distinct Images And assist full time research with
various problems.
RECENT PROJECTS
VISUAL PERCEPTION |
e Detection and segmentation of image/videos objects using advanced
Convolutional Neural Networks to breakthrough in Advance Driver
Assistance,Security,Surveillance, Robotics and Manufacturing industries. We
Made Optimized Solutions for those problems with low computing power.
MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS |
e Microscope for cancer segmentation is instrumental for the diagnosis and staging
of cancer, and thus guides therapy.Deep Learning Algorithm(CNN) to enable on
images captured by camera mounted to the digitalize microscope for image
analysis. It enabling seamless integration of Al into routine workflows.
IMAGE MATTING |
e Matting of images using auto-encoder architecture as base encoder and
refinement of achieved 2k quality using another auto-encoder at end.We Used
it for making Foreground Object to experiment.
IDENTIFICATION OF USER DETAILS |
e Using Deep Learning We verify details whichever given by web development
team,Whether every phrase is in position or not as per user requirements in
User table in database.Mostly rely on LSTM structure.
