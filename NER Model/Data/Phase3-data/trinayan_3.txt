Self Driving Car (Deep Learning Case-Study)
Description In this case study i have used convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to map the raw pixels from a front-facing
camera to the steering commands for a self-driving car. This
powerful end-to-end approach means that with minimum training
data from humans, the system learns to steer, with or without
lane markings, on both local roads and highways. The system
can also operate in areas with unclear visual guidance such as
parking lots or unpaved roads.
Key Skills . EDA: Steering Angles.
