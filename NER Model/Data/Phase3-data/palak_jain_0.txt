EXPERIENCE
TCS Research | RESEARCHER
JULY 2017 - PRESENT | GURUGRAM, HARYANA
¢ Implemented BERT-backend model (TAPAS) to verify complex natural
language facts from semi-structured tables. Building knowledge graphs to
incorporate table relations for improved representation learning and
complex reasoning.
« Designed a domain-agnostic automatic system to extract tabular
information for Question-Answering from PDFs. Improved performance
by 25% against open-source tools (Camelot & Tabula).
¢ Designed a two-level deep neural network model to forecast sales across
72 categories (6M SKUs).
