EXPERIENCE
(CS Tata Consultancy Services India Jan 2018-Present
(5 DATA SCIENCE AND DATA ENGINEERING (Full stack)
The app features modern connected KPIs such as driver score, vehicle health, fuel efficiency score,
Common origins, common destinations, routes, break points based on telematics data.
Built Machine Learning models to power KPIs such as K-Prototype Clustering for generating
Driver's personas, Different models for churn prediction, Association Rule Learning
for subscription recommendation on spark MLIib to handle big data.
Designed and Built Data Pipelines for data ingestion from Data Lakes using presto, for data
Cleaning, transformations and mining through Spark jobs, and for storing analytics output in
RDMS which powers the AI platform.
The app is expected to be used by owners for vehicle maintenance and to improve driving skills,
by OEMs for customer relationship management, by fleet managers for predictive maintenance
and for training needs and by insurance companies to estimate vehicle insurance based on vehicle health.
The application functions on hybrid platforms of both batch and streaming applications where
Azure iot acts as pub-sub model and thereby received by spark streaming applications to perform
Operations and followed by batch processes
Used google and azure maps API for reverse geocoding purposes for poi data, Which thereby used for context
based advertisements on to different requirements quoted
Containerized all the applications using dockers and spinning off kubernetes cluster
Orchestarized and scheduled the application pipeline with airflow using DAGs.
Created flask API to all the applications and exposing the ports for mobile app and for other departments
to carry forward operations
Created application for data anonymization adhering to GDPR.
Been a main part of data model, Data architecture and project discussions.
tos NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
The app demonstrates the complaints produced at National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is
Responsible for keeping people safe on America's roadways and helping reduce the complaints
Generated on vendors at the forum
Developed Named Entity Recognition with the custom dataset generated by scraping from the archives
Of the twitter data, using the Distil-Bert model have created the taxonomy for the manufacturing domain
Established the custom Relationship model using the Transformer model with pytorch framework making
components of taxonomy build intra-relationship, therefore making the vendor have a quick glance and
reducing the timeframe to know about the complaint case and reaching the customer more quicker.
Building the knowledge graph topping to relationship model thereby giving a quick real time glance
Of the customers, complaints, taxonomy there by helping to created ml models to history data created by it
Build a multi-class classification model on Roberta with pytorch, for classifying the tweets on to different
Categories again making the vendor to know more about the customer’s opinions thereby which reducing
Gap between vendor and customer.
