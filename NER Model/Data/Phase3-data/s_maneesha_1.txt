Project Description:
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecommunications industry. Several studies have
shown that attracting new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing ones. The project
aimed at customer Churn Analysis where the loyalty of the customer needs to be identified using descriptive
analytics and provide insights on how to retain the existing customers in the company.
Roles and Responsibilties:
e Processing, cleaning and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis.
e Performed data analysis and visualizations to identify patterns and meaningful business insights.
e Evaluated the tenure and behavior of the customer to determine the loyalty of the customer to the
company.
e Worked with unbalanced data using under sampling, oversampling, SMOTE techniques.
e Performed ad-hoc analysis for POC' s and presented results in a clear manner.
e Selected the important variables and engineered new ones in order to improve the performance of the
model.
e Applied different machine learning algorithms to evaluate churn probabilities and analyzed the accuracy
with each algorithm.
e Worked with internal and external teams to develop and evaluate models, identify the best performing
model and put it into production.
e Developed the predictive model (Customer Churn) to estimate whether the customer will leave the
company and the loss suffered by the company in total ,of all the churns observed.
e Improved the accuracy of prediction from 84% to 96%.
e Provided actionable insights to the business in order to retain current customers with strategic offers.
