Project Description:
Fraud costs the insurance industry millions, if not billions, each year. In response, insurers are marshaling
their data resources and creating a multi-channel approach to fraud detection. They’re taking a very close look
at both traditional structured data (such as claims and policy data), and textual data (such as adjustor notes,
police reports and social media). The project aimed at analyzing the available data to predict whether an
insurance claim is fake or genuine.
Roles and Responsibilties:
e Processing, cleaning, visualization and exploration of data for analysis.
 
e Performed data visualization and data modeling to identify patterns in data.
e Applied multiple machine learning algorithms to predict false claims and evaluated the accuracy of each
algorithm.
e Performed iterative experiments with different techniques to discover the best performing algorithm.
e Worked with extremely unbalanced data using oversampling, under sampling, SMOTE techniques.
e Researched and implemented new techniques to build up on the existing machine learning infrastructure.
e Engineered new features from existing data in order to enhance the model performance for predicting
fraudulent transactions.
e Developed a predictive model to evaluate the probability of the customer claiming false insurance.
e Enabled the fraud detection teams to handle the actual fraud cases three times more effectively.
e Saved the client a lot of money by identifying and decreasing fraudulent behaviors.
