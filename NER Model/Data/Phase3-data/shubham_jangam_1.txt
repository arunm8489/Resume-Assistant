PROJECT
Bottleneck Identification For Website To Identify Productions Problems (08/2020 - 07/2021)
® Inspected for production website problems before customers experience them.
® Established methods in synthetics and browser monitoring within new relic for identify issues in website didn't even know it had.
® Created better auto-complete features also to be better predictions of visualize waterfall charting Features.
® Maximized the solution can be useful for customers frictionless experience and high quality website operating easily reduced
load time down 500MS To 20MS.
Intelligent Scanning To Identify Anatomy On MRIs Of The Brain (07/2019 - 06/2020)
® Solved for approximate location and orientation of desired landmark is identified for diagnosis.
® Implemented technique in built - in - library Function For images manipulation and optimized tensor computations.
® Diagnosed specific anatomy during brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams to help improve speed and realiability.
® Through analysis Found that [[ The solution can be useful For scan operator reduced in errors by 40% to 60% with improved
accuracy and identify subtle changes in anatomy or disease progression over time ]] .
