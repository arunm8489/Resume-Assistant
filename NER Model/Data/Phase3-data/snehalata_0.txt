¢ Table extraction workbench- OCR based solution for table extraction from scanned document using Mobile
Net architecture.
¢ Garden Design Recommendation System - Open-source solution for empty space calculation in a 2D image
by using semantic segmentation model(Mask-RCNN) and then recommend designs.
¢ Brain Tumour Segmentation - Segments and classifies three different tumours present inside the human brain
using UNET architecture.
¢ Driver Drowsiness Detection System - Detects fatigue & drowsiness in those drivers who drive for longer
hours using OpenCV; this project was pitched to UBER.
MyWizard Ingrain Platform (Machine Learning Asset)
¢ Abstractive Text Summarisation - Generates summaries conceptually using transformer networks.
¢ Intent-Entity Classification for Virtual Agents - Classifies intents and extracts entities from a pandas
dataframe using Rasa virtual agent framework and Neural networks, and NLP feature extraction techniques
like TF-IDF, Glove, Word2Vec, Spacy-NER.
