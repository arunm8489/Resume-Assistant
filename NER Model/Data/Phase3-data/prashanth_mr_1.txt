Mini Projects
February - 2020
October - 2018
Model in loop testing of vehicle software using real world vehicle data
In this project the OBD software in the vehicle is developed,tested and
implemented using real world sensor data available in the vehicle.
e It involves the Model in loop testing of the application software in
Simulink via simulation.
Tools used: Matlab , Simulink and m-scripting.
Modelling of a physical temperature sensor using deep learning
Here a temperature sensor in an engine is modelled using deep learning
techniques ,And is now in implementation stage in the vehicle
e Understanding of the issue by going through the vast vehicle real time
data
e Translating the vehicle data to numerical vectors for deep learning
computations
e Building of a deep learning model from basic mathematical functions
like numpy from scratch so to make the model compatible with
different platforms
Tools used: Pycharm, numpy ,Simulink and Matlab
Automated dataset comparison using deep learning techniques
It isa NLP based tool used to automate the process of documentation
e The Documentation of the Engine software for legal approval is long
and time consuming process and is done mostly manually as it
requires human intuition to understand the logic and describe it
e Apart of this activity involves comparing the difference between two
documents but the simple comparison yields highlights lot of
insignificant changes and it is time consuming to go through all of them
»hence a deep learning approach is used which will recognise only the
significant changes
e Here the words in the documents were converted to numerical vectors
and was trained using a deep learning model.
e This tool automates that particular effort by 95%.
Tools used: Pycharm ,excel vba scikit learn, nltk, openpyexcel, numpy
jpandas etc
Dataset calibration tool in python
A GUI based tool for deriving functional saftety calibrations for the engine
from the main calibrations was developed
e The functional safety calibrations were derived by applying
transformations to the 3 dimensional matrices .
e With the help of this tool the process of functional safety calibrations
was automated by 90%.
e The tool is now being used by many engineers of Mercedes Benz in
Germany ,India and North America
Tools used: Pycharm ,tkinter,pyinstaller , openpyexcel, numpy ,pandas etc
Al for tic tac toe game
To explore the practical implementation strategies for reinforcemt learning
an Al based player was created.
Software used: Pycharm,keras,numpy etc.
Implementation of different types of gradient descent optimization
methods using Numpy
Implemented and plotted different types of gradient descent algorithms like
e Stochastic gradient descent
e Momentum based gradient descent
e Adam gradient descent
e Adaptive gradient descent
