Linear regression (project)— In this section, we have built a Linear Regression model to predict Sales
using an appropriate predictor variable.
RESPONSIBILITIES —
DATA UNDERSTANDING: In this process need to load the Data and understand the attributes meaning,
shape of Dataset etc.
Data Analysis: Data analysis involves manipulating, transforming and visualizing data in order to infer
meaningful insights from the results.
Data Visualization: methods used to summarize the distribution and relationships between variables using
visualization such as charts, graphs and plots.
Statistical analysis: the statistical methods used to clean and prepare data ready for modelling.
Data preprocessing: Rescaling the variables, splitting into train and test Data sets etc.
MODEL Development: Building the linear model
HYPER PARAMETER TUNING : K-Fold Cross Validation, Grid Search to find optimal Hyper parameter C
OPTIMIZING FOR OTHER EVALUATION METRICS: in this case, we had optimized the model based on the
accuracy though that may not always be the best metrics to optimize.

CREDIT CARD DEFAULT PREDICTION (project):- in this lab, we will build a random Forest model to
predict the whether a given customer defaults or not. Credit default is one of the most import problem in
the banking and risk analytics. There are various attributes which can be used to predict default, such as
demographical Data behavioral Data etc.
