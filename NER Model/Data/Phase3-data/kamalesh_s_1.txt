Project Summary:
1. Classifying Imbalance Data into a Balanced Data using Sampling Technique in Machine
Learning
Technology: Python — Machine Learning (Scikit Learn)
Project Description:
During training a Machine Learning Fitting of Data in Appro-pirate is important. If you train data in a non
appro-pirate it may affect prediction results. So, In this project I done a sampling Technique to achieve
Appro-pirate fitting and Predication result also nice compare to original data.The Data set which I am using
for this Project is Credit Card Fraud detection in UCI.
2. Food Item Recognition Using Machine Vision in Mobile Application
Technology: Python — OpenCV , Keras and Android Studio
Project Description:
An approach towards Android Application. Nowadays we are working with Deep learning and Android is
