Projects
1.Quora question Pair similarity: Quora is the application where users can answer question
and experts can give answers , Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that
have already been asked This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have been
already answered. But users ask many questions which are repeated or someone asked it before , or they
can be asked in different wording . hence it is time consuming and hectic to the expert who are going to
answer . SO we are created a ML model which can find the text similarity and let us know that incoming
question is repeated or not if it is repeated then the answer of the same question which is asked before
will be send to user and load on expert or answer giver will be reduced.
ROLE :
1)gathered Data from Kaggle 2) perform EDA 3) text and Data preprocessing (Stopwords removal ,
creating tokens , word to vector representation ) 4) Feature Engineering (created new features like
Common word counts, common word share, question 1 and question 2 length cosine similarity, Minimun
edit distance) 5)created features like wordvector 6) created a random model and check performance
7)created machine learning models like Logistic regression ,Random forest and Xgboost 8)Use log loss as
performance metric
2.Linkous (Detection of Malicious links and URL'S using Machine learning )
(Final year project) http://linkous.herokuapp.com/#
In this project is related to cybersecurity and machine learning and NLP. in this project we are
classifying links and URL's as malicious or safe using Lexical analysis of strings and machine learning
classifier. we have also used features like page rank and DNS features to check the authenticity of
that link , we used logistic regression algorithm for prediction because it is giving High accuracy . we
check the parameters in link for classification like [ no of @, no of /, no of _] and using all these
features we are able to classify the link as safe or unsafe
ROLE: 1)Created a front end using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 2) preprocess the data ( remove
duplicated values and remove Nan) 3) created machine learning models Like SVM and Logistic regression
