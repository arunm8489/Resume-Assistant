Currently working as Senior Systems Engineer at
Infosys Limited, since Jun 2018.
e Credit Default Prediction: Our responsibility is to
classify customers of a bank as defaulter or not,
based on their behavior to provide the credit card
to the customers accordingly. Approach: Initially
applied the sampling techniques (SMOTE) to
overcome the class imbalance and then used
classification algorithms (ANN model) to predict
the defaulters.
Weight Prediction: My work involves deployment of
Faster RCNN model to detect digital screen in
images, followed by identifying digits using CNN
model to obtain numerical value present on
screen.
Components Detection: Analyzing the presence of
various components like transistor, capacitor,
RS232 cable etc., in PCB images by comparing
pixels using threshold values with the help of
Template matching technique, which is a
functionality available with open CY library. By this,
automated the process of identifying these
components in the images using Computer vision.
Programming Language: Python
Python packages used: imblearn, statsmodels.api,
sklearn, numpy, pandas, keras, pylab , OpenCV,
Pillow, TensorFlow, imutils, matplotlib, keras.
