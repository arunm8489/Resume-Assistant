popular. So I built a Deep Neural Network learning model (CNN). Which is used for predicting foods using
an Android mobile camera.
3. Heart Diseases Prediction using Flask Framework With Platform as a Cloud Services
Technology: Python — Scikit Learn, Flask Framework, Heroku Cloud
Project Description:
In this Project I developed a Machine Learning model using Pickle file and PAAS . I trained a different type
of Machine Learning algorithm that gave the best accuracy result. I dumped an algorithm model as a .pkl
file and I worked on it with HTML and Flask framework to build a web application. Then dumped all
code and files into Heroku Cloud .
